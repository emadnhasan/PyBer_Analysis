* Urban cities have the highest number of rides, accounting for 1625 of the total 2375 rides. Rural cities only accounted for 125 of the total.
* Urban cities have the most drivers, accounting for 2405 of the total 2973 drivers.
* As a result of contstituting the bulk of rides, urban rides accounted for more than half of PyBer's revenue.
* While only making up 5% of the total rides, the cost of using PyBer is higher by a significant amount in rural areas when compared to suburban and urban.
* Rural rides were more than those in suburban and urban areas, and the average fare per driver in rural areas was more than 3 times that in urban areas.

These findings are further supported by the accompanying line chart. During a span of 5 months, it can be seen that urban fares account for a bulk of PyBer's revenue. Also of note is the increase in traffic occuring at the end of February.   


# Summary
Based on this data, there are opportunities that can be seen for Pyber.
* Because of the higher average fare in rural areas, it would be beneficial to focus more resources and drivers in  those cities. This would lead to higher overall revenue as the number of rides in those area become more comaprable to those in suburban and urban areas.
* There was a notable difference in average fare per ride for the 3 city types. This may be because of longer rides, or how ride rates are calculated. I would recommend further research into this in order to see if this impacts the number of rides in rural areas.
* There is a marked increase in total fares during the last week of February. This can be seen in all 3 city types. It would be beneficial to find out what caused this spike, and in turn how this could be applied to other dates.
